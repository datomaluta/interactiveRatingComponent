## Overview

This is Interactive rating component where you can choose rating and then after clicking on submit you can see your choice with some thanks text. I used Modal.js as Parent, where declare state and passed this state change function using props to children "Active" component. also rating state passed to Result.js component to display our choice. I also have displayResult state which initially is false and after We click on submiy this will be true and we can see result if one of this rating is chosen.
